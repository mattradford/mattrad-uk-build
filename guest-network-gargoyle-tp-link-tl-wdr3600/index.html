            <section>
                <p>I wanted to add a guest network to my router, which is a TP-Link WDR3600 running Gargoyle firmware. I&#8217;ve been able to add one using the following commands, and ensure it&#8217;s isolated from the rest of my wireless and wired networks.</p>
<blockquote><p>The WDR3600 is also known as the N600, and these instructions should also work for the N750 (WDR4300) and the N600 (WDR3500). If only TP-Link could make their product designations even more confusing&#8230; These instructions should also work for vanilla OpenWRT. </p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the below is taken from <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&#038;u=450">pbix&#8217;s</a> instructions on <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=13&#038;t=2743&#038;sid=f4c7f2b3ca0dc7ceeb78583ed79fa2c6">this Gargoyle forum post</a>, with some trial and error.</p>
<p>First: <code>ssh root@192.168.1.1</code></p>
<p>Then, add a new network using <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci">OpenWRT&#8217;s uci system</a>, which is a centralised way of configuring the router.</p>
<pre># add the new wireless network
uci set wireless.ap_g2=wifi-iface
uci set wireless.ap_g2.device=radio0
uci set wireless.ap_g2.mode=ap
uci set wireless.ap_g2.network=lan

# name the SSID
uci set wireless.ap_g2.ssid=(your SSID)

# make sure clients are isolated from each other
uci set wireless.ap_g2.isolate=1

# you can set the below to "none" and omit the following uci command if you don't want password protection
uci set wireless.ap_g2.encryption=psk2
uci set wireless.ap_g2.key=(your password)

# save your changes
uci commit</pre>
<p>We&#8217;ve already made clients isolated from one another (using <code>uci set wireless.ap_g2.isolate=1</code> above). Now we will set firewall rules to isolate guest network clients from other devices on existing wireless and wired networks.</p>
<p>So open up <code>/usr/lib/gargoyle_firewall_util/gargoyle_firewall_util.sh</code> and find the <code>initialize_firewall()</code> block.</p>
<pre>initialize_firewall()
{
        # This part won't need any changes
        iptables -I zone_lan_forward -i br-lan -o br-lan -j ACCEPT
        insert_remote_accept_rules
        insert_dmz_rule
        create_l7marker_chain
        block_static_ip_mismatches
        force_router_dns
        add_adsl_modem_routes

        # Add the lines below to isolate the guest wifi from your LAN
        ebtables -I FORWARD -i wlan0-1 -o wlan0 -j DROP
        ebtables -I FORWARD -i wlan0-1 -o wlan1 -j DROP
        ebtables -I FORWARD -i wlan0-1 -o eth0.1 -j DROP

}</pre>
<p>Finally, <code>reboot</code>. Once your router comes back up you should have a guest network in place.</p>
<p>I had a few problems adding a SSID with a space in it, e.g. &#8220;Guest Network&#8221;. I had to delete the whole config under <code>/etc/config/wireless</code> and start again (with a <code>reboot</code> in between), and call it &#8220;GuestNetwork&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not perfect, as this setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>allows anyone on the guest network to see OpenVPN clients on that network, if you have OpenVPN configured</li>
<li>does not allow for specific bandwidth monitoring on the guest network, although you can set <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/wiki/doku.php?id=qos">QoS</a>
</li>
<li>it messes with the GUI a bit, meaning that wireless settings have to be changed in <code>/etc/config/wireless</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But it all works and guests have their own slice of my network without seeing all the other devices on it.</p>
