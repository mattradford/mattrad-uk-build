<p>In 1996 I was studying at UEA for a Masters degree in American Studies, under <a href="https://people.uea.ac.uk/r_crockatt">Professor Richard Crockatt</a>. This involved literary and cultural analysis of works since 1960, and I was asked by Prof. Crockatt to review Douglas Rushkoff&#8217;s recent book &#8220;<a href="https://rushkoff.com/books/cyberia/">Cyberia</a>&#8220;, along with William Gibson&#8217;s classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>. <em>Cyberspace</em> was all a bit woo-woo back then, wrapped up in the hippies&#8217; acid-dipped ideas of group consciousness, but at the same time very open, and hopeful of the possibilities that the Internet could bring.</p>



<p>I thought the best way to review these books was to get on to the web myself, to explore, make connections and then design my own web pages &#8211; to try and show rather than tell. And so I took my own trip of discovery, first around campus to try and find the gatekeepers to getting online. I remember no-one seemed to know how the university created web pages, nor where they were stored. But eventually I headed down the green-screened rabbit hole of the terminal, and the magic command <code>vi index.htm</code> which &#8211; amazingly, and much later &#8211; made my own web pages visible within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">NCSA Mosaic browser</a>.</p>



<p>Here are my first ever webpages, rescued a few years ago from a 3.5&#8243; floppy disk <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">(a what?)</a>, and modernised a little in 2006. These pages were written before the dotcom bubble burst, so you&#8217;ll have to ease around the hyperbole ðŸ˜‰</p>
