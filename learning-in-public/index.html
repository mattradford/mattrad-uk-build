<p><em>Serendipity</em>. Sometimes things come along just at the right moment. I read an email newsletter on Friday called <em>Learning in Public</em> by <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/">Tania Rascia</a>. She described how she’s been documenting her development on her blog:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Writing down what you learn helps you retain it, understand it more deeply, improve your communication, and has the added benefit of helping others who stumble upon your site. It doesn&#8217;t matter if anyone else sees it or only you, because the benefit is still there.</p></blockquote>



<p>Yes! This is exactly what I want to do with my new blog. To learn in the open as I develop it, showing my successes and failures. To have it available as a teaching tool for anyone who stumbles across it. To not worry about showing what I don’t know.</p>



<p>That’s the essence of the web for me. Everything open for others to see and learn from. No walled gardens or obfuscations. <em>View source</em> FTW.</p>
