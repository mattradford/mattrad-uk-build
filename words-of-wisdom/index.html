<p>Jeremy Keith&#8217;s &#8220;1 piece of advice around building responsively&#8221;, from this week&#8217;s interview in <a href="https://responsivedesign.is/">responsivedesign.is</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I think that even now, there&#8217;s still a tendency for people to think of the desktop view as the default, and the small-screen view as the exception. That&#8217;s a recipe for frustration.</p>
<p>Think about your content first (whether it&#8217;s a task or it&#8217;s information) in the absence of any screen.</p>
<p>Then think about that content on a small, constrained screen.</p>
<p>Finally, allow yourself to think about that content in the context of a larger screen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yes. Content first, then design. What you need to <em>say</em> is more important than how it&nbsp;<em>looks</em>. Design is&nbsp;the least important part of web design. And that design needs to be added in little appropriate increments as the screen size increases and allows.</p>



<p>But people don&#8217;t get it. <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/opinion/2353616/mobile-now-exceeds-pc-the-biggest-shift-since-the-internet-began">Mobile overtook desktop in 2014</a>. A larger screen is now a progressive enhancement. Hell, with things like Siri and Google Now and Amazon&#8217;s Echo, we&#8217;re getting to the point where even a <em>screen</em> is an enhancement.</p>



<p>Yet for now, it&#8217;s mobile-first every time, please.</p>
