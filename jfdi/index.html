            <section>
                <p>This morning I read <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/getting-to-50k">an excellent post</a> by Alex Turnbull of Groove. It reminded me that blogging is important in establishing reputation. If I&#8217;m going to claim I&#8217;m a WordPress expert, then I&#8217;d better start demonstrating that. I want to document the challenges that I face (which clients mostly never hear about) in delivering websites of which I can be proud to say, &#8220;I made that&#8221;.</p>
<p>But how long have I been saying I&#8217;ll start writing again? [footnote]I used to write on everything iPhone at <a href="http://allaboutiphone.net/">All About iPhone</a>, and I made sure I posted regularly. It was quite fun geeking out over the latest Apple devices, but then web development took over and it slowly tailed off.[/footnote] I reckon a couple of years. And there&#8217;s always something &#8211; whether it&#8217;s client work or just <em>life</em> &#8211; that gets in the way. Because I thought I needed to build my Proper Business Website first. But I didn&#8217;t; I just needed to <em>start</em>.</p>
<p>Projects always seem overbearing and unmanageable until you break them down into chunks. Even setting up this blog and writing the first post seemed a little daunting &#8211; given all the other things that I need to do at the moment &#8211; until I turned it into a series of smaller items to get through. And I did. In the course of this afternoon and evening I went from having a placeholder website to having a blog that I&#8217;m very happy with.</p>
<p>So I haven&#8217;t made the really professional business website that I imagined, but I have made a start. And the first step is the most important one. As one of my Aikido teachers once said to me, &#8220;The first thing is to start. The next thing is not to stop&#8221;.</p>
