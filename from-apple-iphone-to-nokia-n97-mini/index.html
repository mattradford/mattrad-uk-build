<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<p>Guest author Matt Radford (of <a href="http://www.allaboutiphone.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All About iPhone</a>) borrowed my Nokia N97 mini for a few weeks recently. His aim? To see if he could switch to it from his beloved Apple iPhone. Matt was a hardened Symbian user in times past with a love of the S60 2nd Edition-powered Nokia N70, so this was an especially interesting experiment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="480" height="360" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/matt.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1039" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/matt.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/matt-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></figure>



<p><em>Matt Radford</em></p>



<p>A long time ago (in mobile) I used a Symbian phone, and I loved it. My Nokia N70 was an incredibly capable device &#8211; compact, durable and feature-laden. But I moved from S60 &#8211; describing why <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/features/item/From_S60_to_iPhone.php">in an article here for All About Symbian</a> &#8211; as I found the iPhone experience to be far more enjoyable. And this was even before the App Store launched.</p>



<p>But recently Nokia has released quite a few nice-looking touchscreens. So Steve Litchfield offered to lend me his N97 mini, because I wanted to answer this question:</p>



<p><em><strong>If I had to ditch my iPhone today, would the N97 mini cut it as a replacement?</strong></em></p>



<p>I was specifically interested in moving to back to Symbian with touch, and seeing if I could replicate the great user experience of my iPhone. This isn&#8217;t a me-too review &#8211; AAS has already <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/reviews/item/Nokia_N97_Review-Part_1-First_impressions.php">reviewed the N97</a> <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/10701_Review_the_Nokia_N97_mini-part.php">and N97 Mini</a> at length &#8211; but more a comparison of platforms. I wasn&#8217;t looking to customise the UI to match an iPhone, or trying to make it what it isn&#8217;t. I looked at things I now consider to be the &#8220;core&#8221; usage of my phone, and asked, &#8220;Could I do the same things I do everyday on my iPhone?&#8221;. That&#8217;s all.</p>



<p>These are things I consider &#8220;core&#8221; to my phone, just every day stuff:</p>



<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Texts</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Calls</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Email</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Camera</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Calendar</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To-Dos</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Web</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Music</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RSS feeds</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twitter</li>
</ul>



<p>I&#8217;m not much of a gamer, so that didn&#8217;t get a look-in. To the above, I also added synchronisation. My phone hasn&#8217;t been a standalone device since I owned a Nokia 7650.</p>



<h3>SO HOW DID THE N97 MINI FARE?</h3>



<p>First off, the physical differences.</p>



<p>In general, the phone felt solid. So solid that I had to use pliers to get Steve&#8217;s SIM out! But other than that, really nicely put together and good in the hands. The screen&#8217;s more than adequate, but as it&#8217;s winter, I didn&#8217;t get a chance to test it in decent sunlight. The large screen felt on a par with the amount of screen real estate I&#8217;ve come to expect in a touch device.</p>



<p>However, the phone itself was quite slippery (especially when opening up the slide), causing me to drop it a couple of times (don&#8217;t tell Steve! You what????!! Arghh!! &#8211; Ed). But this is just like my iPhone &#8211; both phones need a case to provide better grip.</p>



<p>And a novelty &#8211; a physical keyboard! Yet I found that my typing was no quicker on the N97 mini than on my iPhone. Maybe it&#8217;s a matter of familiarity, but I think the fact that it was a QWERTY keyboard was more important than having actual buttons to press.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="507" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/n97s-4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1038" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/n97s-4.jpg 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/n97s-4-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<h3>OK, HARDWARE OUT OF THE WAY. HOW DID THE SOFTWARE COMPARE?</h3>



<p>The phone was running firmware 10.0.020 14-10-09. Setup was all very nice (no need to connect to iTunes of course!) Once my SIM was in, the Pay Monthly APN settings came through by text for O2, and I was quickly on the 3G network. Adding Wifi access meant delving somewhere into settings, but the phone got onto my WPA2 network without any problems. I&#8217;m not sure I understand the whole &#8220;Access Point&#8221; thing though, it seemed unnecessarily confusing.</p>



<p>Anyway, I had connectivity, and could explore the phone&#8217;s functions.</p>



<h4>SMS</h4>



<p>Basic texting is good (hello character count!), but I&#8217;ve grown used to threaded SMS on the iPhone, and especially grown to like a conversation view.&nbsp; I found an app called <a href="http://forum.dailymobile.se/index.php/topic,3078.0.html">Free-iSMS for S60</a>, but I have to get it signed(!) to install it, and I couldn&#8217;t see how to do that. Shame.</p>



<h4>Camera</h4>



<p>I&#8217;ve taken some surprisingly good photos on my iPhone, but this is in a different league. Just look at those options! Some of these things I can correct for (using the Photoshop Mobile app) on my iPhone, but I&#8217;d rather do it at front end. And another novelty &#8211; a flash! I&#8217;ve always rated Nokia&#8217;s camera functions, and the excellence of the N97 mini&#8217;s camera has had me pining for a decent camera again.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="730" height="441" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/n97s-20.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1037" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/n97s-20.jpg 730w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/n97s-20-300x181.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px"></figure>



<h4>RSS</h4>



<p>I reckon I do most of my reading on my iPhone these days, mainly through an app called <a href="http://www.phantomfish.com/byline.html">Byline</a> that syncs with my Google Reader account. So my one and only paid purchase from the Ovi Store (more on that later) was <a href="http://www.symbian-guru.com/welcome/2009/10/exclusive-preview-of-greader-dedicated-google-reader-client-for-symbian.html">gReader</a>. After only a few minutes of usage, I&#8217;d decided it&#8217;s even better than Byline on my iPhone. All the options you could want, and as pleasing as the Google website on a desktop. Just excellent. Can I have an iPhone version please?</p>



<h4>Twitter</h4>



<p><a href="http://mobileways.de/gravity">Gravity</a> does the job. A clean interface, multiple account support, etc. Superb. I&#8217;m not sure if Twitter-native retweet is supported yet, but even so, another great S60 app. Looking good!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="360" height="640" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gravity000016.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1036" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gravity000016.jpg 360w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gravity000016-169x300.jpg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"></figure>

<p><em>Ah but then:</em></p>



<h4>To-dos</h4>



<p>Native to-do functionality is fine for shopping lists, but is no good for Getting Things Done-style task management. On my iPhone, I use &#8216;Things&#8217;, which syncs over Wifi to the Things app on my Mac. I absolutely depend it every day. But could I find any decent GTD clients for S60? Nope, not a peep of one. And <a href="http://tom.goskar.com/2009/07/10/to-do-managers-on-symbian-s60-where-are-they/">it&#8217;s not just me</a>. Surely someone in the S60 smartphone community could write one? Don&#8217;t S60 users like being productive? This is a real problem for me in switching back to S60.</p>



<h4>Calendar / Email / Contacts</h4>



<p>I use <a href="https://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a> on my iPhone for all of this, using over-the-air sync. But could I get set up on the N97 Mini? No chance. Email setup went into an endless loop of failure messages (Nokia Messaging &#8211; ah, so it&#8217;s not just me then &#8211; Ed]. Contacts and Calendar at least transferred from my Mac via iSync using <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/isync/compatibility-and-download">the official Nokia plugin</a>; it nicely synced across the photos for contacts and displayed them on the contacts list. Amazingly, I have to (ahem) jailbreak my iPhone and buy a dedicated app (<a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/info/cyntact/">Cyntact</a>) to get this functionality.</p>



<p>Several Litchfield-ian &#8220;Gah!&#8221;s later, I gave up. This was very disappointing, as I really wanted to test this stuff. But even so, I&#8217;m sure the N97 mini is more than capable. I found that <a href="http://www.lonelycatgames.com/?app=profimail">Profimail</a> is still going, and even has a homescreen widget for the N97, so there is an alternative to S60&#8217;s terrible built-in client. But had Steve not told me about <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/find-products/nokia-for-business/software/email-and-instant-messaging/mail-for-exchange">Mail for Exchange</a> (to get Google sync working), I would have been incredibly frustrated.</p>



<h4>Phone</h4>



<p>It&#8217;s the little things that make the difference. The iPhone has a lovely intuitive phone function, but it was great to use a phone that could:</p>



<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;set a contact&#8217;s default number for calls and texts;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;integrate VoIP dialling into the Address Book;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;automatically re-dial a number if it&#8217;s engaged.</li>
</ul>



<p>On this front, the N97 mini was a welcome reminder of how a phone &#8211; the basic function of this device &#8211; should operate. Plus the speakerphone is excellent.</p>



<h4>Web</h4>



<p>This is where I really missed multi-touch. It&#8217;s so intuitive. Having to zoom in and out with explicit icons seems like a retrograde step, and detracts from the ease of reading. Also, when you&#8217;re filling in a form, there&#8217;s no &#8220;Next&#8221; button to skip to the next field &#8211; you have to touch on it instead. Overall, it&#8217;s ok but certainly not as pleasant as Safari on the iPhone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="381" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/photo2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1034" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/photo2.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/06/photo2-300x179.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<h4>Music</h4>



<p>Playing music was fine; not as fluid as on the iPhone, but passable. A case of good enough, although I had to <a href="http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=embedart">embed my album artwork into the AAC files themselves</a> in order to get it on the N97 mini (because of the way iTunes now stores album art).</p>



<h4>Media Sync</h4>



<p>Getting media synced onto the N97 mini from my Mac had also hugely improved since my last outing with <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/download-software/nokia-multimedia-transfer">Nokia Multimedia Transfer</a> on the Mac. Counter-intuitively, you don&#8217;t connect your N97 mini in &#8216;Media Transfer&#8217; mode, but PC Suite. It was also unclear that I had to unplug the USB cable for the &#8220;Refresh music library&#8221; option to show, which meant I synced a few times before I figured out what was going on.</p>



<p>NMT&#8217;s a bit more convoluted than just plugging an iPhone into iTunes, but once set up, it&#8217;s excellent. It does a lovely job of iPhoto import and sync, and syncing Safari bookmarks &#8211; although it didn&#8217;t preserve the bookmarks folder structure, merging them all into one big folder.</p>



<h3>OVI. OY VEY.</h3>



<p>Ah, and then there&#8217;s the <a href="https://store.ovi.com/">Ovi Store</a>. One of the things I love about my iPhone is the ease of getting apps. The iTunes account on my Mac simply synced to the App Store. On my iPhone, I just started using it, with the occasional password entry required. Easy. With the Ovi Store, however, I first had to update the store (huh?), then try and sign up. Which was a chore. Have you seen <a href="http://thereallymobileproject.com/2009/10/shopping-at-the-ovi-store/">The Really Mobile Project’s video</a>? Thankfully I avoided the Hannah Montana deluge, but here&#8217;s a summary of my sign-up:</p>



<p>&#8220;Enter all your details, then enter a CAPTCHA. But bringing up the keyboard takes the view of the CAPTCHA away. I got the CAPTCHA wrong, then the reloaded page didn&#8217;t show it, then it did show and I entered it correctly, only to find out that my username was already taken. Then another &#8220;Invalid CAPTCHA&#8221;. Then another &#8220;Username already exists&#8221;. Eventually&#8230; my account was created. Then I had to accept the Ts and Cs that I&#8217;d already accepted. Finally &#8211; account created! Thank $deity for that.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Editor&#8217;s note: I wonder how many people try signing up to Ovi using <em>just the phone itself</em>? I originally created my account in a desktop web browser, for example. Your comments welcome, here!]</p>



<p>I made it through, but had (say) my Dad encountered it, then there would have been no sign up completed. Please Nokia, make this easier. Yet once I&#8217;d passed the Ovi stress test, I found it fine to use. It&#8217;s a bit user-unfriendly, and it took a while to navigate through, but it got the job done.</p>



<h3>OVERALL</h3>



<p>I was not entirely convinced that touch-enabling S60 has worked for Nokia. It feels ok but not great. Certainly there are small things that need improving, e.g. on the iPhone you can tap the&nbsp; status bar to jump back to the top of a long page in any app, which sounds a tiny thing to highlight, but it saves an awful lot of time scrolling.</p>



<p>And this is not to say that touch can&#8217;t work on Symbian &#8211; I had a Samsung i8910HD for a few months, and the feel of that device was very different. Perhaps it was the very large screen, but it felt like touch was not a bolt-on. It felt natural.</p>



<p>In contrast, I also borrowed a Nokia N86 from Steve recently, and absolutely loved it. I&#8217;d noted the praise from the likes of <a href="http://thereallymobileproject.com/2009/09/love-your-n95-get-the-nokia-n86/">James Whatley</a> and <a href="http://mynokiablog.com/2009/08/18/video-samples-of-the-nokia-n86s-impressive-digital-zoom/">James Burland</a>, and have to concur. The N86 is an example of an end-of-the-line, all-the-little-bits-tweaked phone that showcases how powerful and polished S60 can be &#8211; when buttons are the input mechanism.</p>



<p>The N97 mini left me with the impression that S60 still needs to abstract all the technical cruft away, in favour of simplifying things for the user &#8211; email setup for Gmail and Ovi Store account creation being prime examples. And some of my niggles can probably be fixed with a bit of Googling. But for me, the saving grace is the number of apps now available, even if it doesn&#8217;t have the breadth of Apple&#8217;s App Store, or include personal favourites such as <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://www.touchnote.com/">Touchnote</a>. Downloadable apps means that if I wanted to, I could switch back to S60 fairly easily, and go about my day.</p>



<p>Trying out the N97 mini has forced me to consider what I use really use my phone for, and has made plain that me definition of &#8220;core usage&#8221; has changed immensely since I switched from my N70. I&#8217;d be happy to use an N97 mini as my main phone, but Symbian needs to feel like it&#8217;s designed for touch with a simple, fluid user interface. Roll on Symbian^4&#8230;</p>
