                <h3>&#8220;A Beginners Guide to Web Accessibility&#8221;</h3>
<h3>What legislation do we need to be aware of?</h3>
<p>(cf. Norwegian law as of July 1st &#8211; all sites must be accessible)</p>
<p>But which standards?</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>WCAG v2 &#8211; W3C published.</li>
<li>A (mandatory), AA (most pragmatic), AAA (impossible!)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>AA is most pragmatic</p>
<h3>Most important thing to make a site accessible?</h3>
<p>&#8220;Enabling the web so that everyone can access its content when they want to and how they need to&#8221;</p>
<p>Accessibility is not black and white &#8211; can be fine for some but totally inaccessible for others</p>
<p>Accessibility can increase profitability.</p>
<h3>More people are affected by poor accessibility that you think.</h3>
<p>12m in UK have a recognised disability. 15m &gt; 55 old.</p>
<p>So (roughly) 16.5m could benefit from good acc.</p>
<p>Not all about blind people. Blindness is a legal term, some registered blind can see things<br>
1/12 have colour blindness.</p>
<p>2.6m people have difficulty using their hands.</p>
<p><em>Ida Aalen</em>: websites must be navigable by keyboard, touch &amp; mouse.</p>
<p>2m people have a hearing impairment.<br>
2m people are dyslexic.<br>
2.2m have memory difficulties.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t make assumptions about who is visiting your site, e.g. a blind parent browsing for a skateboard for a child.<br>
Impacts on your business; reputation.</p>
<p>People with disabilities represent a market worth £80bn in UK.<br>
83% of PWD will not return to a business that meerts their needs.</p>
<h3>Law</h3>
<p>Equality Act 2010 (supplemanted DDA, except in NI). Specifically refers to websites, but does not define reasonable steps.</p>
<h4>&#8220;No-one gets sued anyway&#8221;.</h4>
<p>BMI sued in 2012 by RNIB as you couldn&#8217;t book a seat without a mouse.</p>
<h4>Types of disability/impairment</h4>
<p>Visual, Motor, Deafness &amp; Hard of Hearing, Epilepsy, Cognitive (dyslexia, autism, ADHD).</p>
<h3>Mitigating impairment</h3>
<p>Lots of people with accessibility needs use IE because it has good accessibility built in, same with Firefox. Not Chrome.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">IE, FF users can specify colours</span><br>
Adjust text size without zooming</p>
<p>Absolute pixel values cannot be adjusted in IE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Assistive technology</h4>
<p>Glasses<br>
Zooming in<br>
JAWS screenreader<br>
Dragon voice recognition</p>
<p>&#8211; voice recognition built into OS X, iOS</p>
<p>Refreshable braille display &#8211; Wow<br>
Motor switches controlled by feet, shoulders, etc</p>
<p>JAWS costs $895!<br>
Braille display &#8211; $4k!!!<br>
Open source srceenreader &#8211; NVDA</p>
<p>&#8211; Also VoiceOver in iOS and OS X &#8211; plug and play with braille displays<br>
&#8211; https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/osx/voiceover/<br>
&#8211; https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/ios/voiceover/</p>
<p>iOS is the tool of choice for Blind people.</p>
<p>Android version of VoiceOver is called TalkBack, but its not as good.</p>
<h3>WordPress accessibility is influeced by:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Theme devs</li>
<li>Plugin devs</li>
<li>Content authors</li>
</ul>
<p>75% websites have some sort of accessibility issue.</p>
<p><strong>Every accessibility step you take will make life easier for someone</strong></p>
<h3>Simple things to do:</h3>
<ul>
<li>alt text images</li>
<li>descrbe what image shows or represents</li>
<li>if a link, describe destination</li>
<li>if decorative, leave blank (use alt=&#8221;&#8221;) &#8211; screen readers know to ignore</li>
<li>WP will put a blank alt tag in if content picker is used.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Links</h4>
<p>Use &#8220;my blog post: read more&#8221; not my blog post: &#8220;read more&#8221;<br>
&#8211; means links in screen reader will be appropriate, not just a bunch of &#8220;read more&#8221;s.</p>
<h4>Use headings properly</h4>
<p>&#8211; semantics<br>
&#8211; used as a nav mechanism by screen readers &#8211; signpost content<br>
&#8211; HTML5 H1s?<br>
&#8211; &#8211; screenreaders cannot cope with this</p>
<h4>Keyboard focus and operation.</h4>
<p>&#8211; focus should be easily visible<br>
&#8211; .hover &amp; .focus together?<br>
&#8211; tab order should make sense (less of an issue with WP sites)<br>
&#8211; ensure all functionality accessible by keystrokes<br>
&#8211; test your own website using tab, arrow and spacebar</p>
<h4>Text</h4>
<p>&#8211; contrast<br>
&#8211; allow resizing without breaking the layout<br>
&#8211; don&#8217;t use fully justified text &#8211; makes it a lot harder to read, esp. for thos with dyslexia and congnotive impairments<br>
&#8211; Dyslexic-appropriate fonts?</p>
<h4>Forms</h4>
<p>&#8211; use labels for input fields, link id to input field<br>
&#8211; important for screenreaders: if no label, they will get confused<br>
&#8211; &#8211; how does Gravity Forms cope with this?<br>
&#8211; don&#8217;t use captchas<br>
&#8211; generate appropriate errors</p>
<h4>WAI-ARIA</h4>
<p>&#8211; labelling areas with roles</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s hard to retrofit accessibility.</strong></p>
