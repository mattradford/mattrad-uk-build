<p>Last time I got my writing groove on, I wrote <a href="https://mattrad.uk/jfdi">&#8220;&#8230;blogging is important in establishing reputation&#8221;</a>.</p>



<p>5 years later and it&#8217;s more &#8220;Meh&#8221;. If I want to write, I&#8217;ll write. But I want to <em>own</em> my writing, my thoughts. It matters that it&#8217;s here, on my space on the web, not on someone else&#8217;s. I want more of that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">Geocities</a> feel. I used to just make a website for fun, so I want more of that. How much will be written remains to be seen.</p>



<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m curating the stuff I&#8217;ve already published. There&#8217;s a fair bit that&#8217;s accumulated over the years and I&#8217;m gradually going through it all, putting posts back up as I have time. I&#8217;m taking this as an opportunity to do something other than <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> &#8211; because a website like this doesn&#8217;t need a database, and will have more longevity without one. I&#8217;m learning to use <a href="https://11ty.io/">Eleventy</a>, a JavaScript-based static site generator, because JS is eating everything. And I get to use all the modern CSS I like, not that there&#8217;s much CSS going on here at the moment ðŸ˜‰</p>
