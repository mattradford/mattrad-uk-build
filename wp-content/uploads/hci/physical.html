<p>Designing the physical interface involves the actual ergonomics and tactile feel of a system - the bits a user pushes and pulls! Physical interfaces can successfully help give a game far more convincing feel and atmosphere. Two examples used often in games are car steering wheels and light pistols, and more recently "rumble-packs" which vibrate. These give games an extra dimension, sometimes including physical feedback.

<p>In a recent debate the Managing Director of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon Books</a><a></a> claimed his researchers had found a preference amongst staff for using hand-held tablets when reading electronic documents. This seemed to identify a need to read away from a computer, with a portable interface.

</p>
<p>Seemingly, the closest to (a non-computer) "reality" as possible appears to win greatest satisfaction.
